### Summary

Datatypes &amp; reference algorithms for [IBC](https://github.com/cosmos/ics), later to be converted into proofs.

Idris has not been evaluated for optimality as a proof language ([discussion](https://github.com/cosmos/ics/issues/42)), so for now these are just datatypes and functions.

### Usage

To typecheck the protocol:

```bash
make check
```

To open up a REPL and play around with protocol components, run:

```bash
make
```
